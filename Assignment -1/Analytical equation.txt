For a mass-spring system:

    a = F/m = -k*x/m = x''

so we have:

    x'' + k*x/m = 0

Assume x= A*(e**(n*t)):
    
    we can get n should be i or -i

so x = A*cos(t) + B* sin(t)

at t = 0, x = 0 and v = 1

so that we can get x = sin(t) and v = cos(t)

this satisfies the figures got from programs (is the precision of dt is high enough)
