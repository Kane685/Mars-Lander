I made an interactive graph whose dt can be changed based on sliders so that the comparison can be more obvious.

The instruction asked to set t_max to 1000 but this will make the graph filled with lines so t_max is set to 100.
(no influence because 100 is enough to see whether the integration diverges or not)

From the graph, Euler method never converges. It turns to be more accurate as dt decreases.
From the graph, Verlet method is stable under a specific dt which is between 1 and 2.
